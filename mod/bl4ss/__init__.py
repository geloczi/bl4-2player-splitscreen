"""
BL4 2-Player Split-Screen Unlocked — two-player local split-screen for Borderlands 4 on PC.

The game already ships couch co-op; on PC it never finishes setting up the second local player. This mod:
- adds Player 2 on the main menu when a second controller is connected (or with a hotkey), so P2 can pick a save
  from the game's own "Load Vault Hunter" menu;
- offers a hotkey that swaps the two players' platform users while a new P2 character is created — the Shared
  Progression screen only accepts the signed-in platform user;
- gives P2 the same DLC entitlements as P1, so DLC Vault Hunters aren't padlocked for P2 (see entitlements.py);
- marks P2 "client ready" when it travels, so it actually arrives in the world (see native.py);
- keeps one player's menu from dropping the other half to 10% render resolution (see render.py);
- keeps P1's mouse look while P2's menu is open, and makes P2's controller cursor visible in menus.
